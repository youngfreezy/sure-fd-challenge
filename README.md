### TODO
There were a few things I know I could do to improve the application:
- Integration Tests. I looked into Cypress, and the next thing I would do is integrate cypress. After working with Capybara in Rails I'm a fan of end to end testing.
- improve the error validation, particularly the server side validation so it can be extended to other fields, and match the front end error object with the server side error object.
