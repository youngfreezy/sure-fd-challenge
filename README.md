This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### TODO
There were a few things I know I could do to improve the application:
- put the Select/MenuItem (from QuoteOverViewVariableOptions) in its own component
- Integration Tests. I looked into Cypress, and the next thing I would do is integrate cypress. After working with Capybara in Rails I'm a fan of end to end testing.
